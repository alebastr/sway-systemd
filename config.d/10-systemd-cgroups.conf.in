# Automatically assign a dedicated systemd scope to the GUI applications
# launched in the same cgroup as the compositor. This could be helpful for
# implementing cgroup-based resource management and would be necessary when
# `systemd-oomd` is in use.
#
# Limitations: The script is using i3ipc window:new event to detect application
# launches and would fail to detect background apps or special surfaces.
# Therefore it's recommended to supplement the script with use of systemd user
# services for such background apps.
